# Radar Signal Transmission and Reception using ADALM-PLUTO SDR

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for implementing and testing different radar signal types using the **ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radio (SDR)**.  
The project demonstrates the transmission and reception of the following signal types:
- Pulsed signals  
- Chirped signals  
- Square waves  

These scripts provide a hands-on approach to understanding radar Waveforms.

## Features
- Transmission and reception of radar signals with ADALM-PLUTO.  
- Implementation of multiple waveform types (pulse, chirp, square).  
- Signal processing and analysis using MATLAB.  
- Modular design for further SDR experimentation and research.

## Requirements
Before running the scripts, ensure the following MATLAB toolboxes are installed:
- **Communications Toolbox Support Package for ADALM-PLUTO Radio**  
- **Signal Processing Toolbox**

Hardware required:
- **ADALM-PLUTO SDR device**
